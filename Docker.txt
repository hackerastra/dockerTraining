Docker  ? 

Docker is a containerization platform used for packaging an application and its dependencies together within a Docker Container. 

This ensures smooth functioning of an application irrespective of changes in the platform or environment. 

Why Docker was created ? 

"<it works on my machine but not working on your machine>"


Architecture 


Container 1 Container 2                   Layer 3 

App + Lib   App + Lib

Docker                                    Layer 2

Host OS                                   Layer 1

How Docker is different from VMware or Virtualization ? 


Dockerfile 

A text documents that contains the list of commads which can be invoked by a user in CLI in order to creeate or assemble an docker image. 

Dockerfile ----> Build ----> Dockerimage (can be treated as an executable file) --->Runs -----> Container


Container is the running instances of a docker image. Ready to use applications which are created from Docker Images that is the ultimate utility of docker images.
